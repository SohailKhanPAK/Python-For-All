Its citizens are capable of dealing with their problems. Karachi is a new city but it is old in its wisdom and tolerance.

Thirteen prominent writers of Karachi take the reader through post-independence developments in politics, economics, the arts, demography and architecture. Some of the articles are very personal, evoking nostalgia for the Karachi that was; others are analytical, drawing on available data to predict the course that this turbulent city will take in the future.

The anti-Shia fatwas were ‘managed’ through a Deobandi scholar of India, Manzur Numani, who had earlier written a book against Imam Khomeini and Iran. Funded by the Saudi charity Rabita Alam Islami (World Islamic League), he wrote to the Deobandi seminaries of India and Pakistan, asking them to give their juristic opinion on the Shia faith. In 1986, all of them sent to him fatwas declaring the Shias as kafirs or non-Muslims. No attention was paid by the state to the character of the Shia faith in Pakistan; a grave mistake made at the political level by politicians and military officers controlling and directing a very dubious jihad in Afghanistan and Kashmir.\\r\\nThe state colluded with the Shia massacres that followed next because the Shia-killers were all its proxy warriors. This book traces the roots of the sectarian conflict in the Muslim past in India, and throws light at the new developments in the Middle East after the replacement of the socialist Arab leaders with religious scholars, and the rise of Shia Iran under Imam Khomeini. It narrates and analyses the relocated Arab-Iran religious war inside Pakistan, leveraged with Saudi funds and executed by clerics who received spiritual and financial support from the clerical authorities in Saudi Arabia and Iran.

On the contrary, it provides incontrovertible documentary evidence that Dr Homi J. Bhabha formulated with Nehru’s approval a nuclear weapons development strategy within the structural framework of the Indian civilian nuclear programme. Nehru was interested in a nuclear weapons capability for a ‘deterrent in extremis’. \\r\\nThe study’s central premise is that the BJP government’s decision to carry out the May 1998 nuclear tests was not original, but a step prefigured in a strategic continuum whose genesis dates back to the late 1950s. It suggests that the declaration of Indian nuclear deterrence after the May 1998 nuclear tests, the weaponization of Indian nuclear capability and the pronouncement of the Draft Nuclear Doctrine were not separate from earlier policies, but instead were part of that strategic continuum.

G. Noorani', 'Book Description': 'The distinguished Indian lawyer and writer, A.G. Noorani, urges his readers in this incisively argued book to look again at some of the key events and personalities in the struggle against British colonial rule in India. He begins with ‘the forgotten comradeship’ between Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Whatever their other differences, both felt passionately about the cause of Indian freedom. Jinnah defended Tilak in his trial in 1916 on sedition charges, and ultimately secured his acquittal. The full text of the legal proceedings, including Jinnah’s powerful speeches for the defence, are included as an appendix. After Tilak’s death in 1920, Jinnah continued to work closely with political leaders of all persuasions and was regarded by the British as one of their most formidable opponents. Noorani argues that only in 1937, following the conflict over the formation of the provincial ministry in the United Provinces, did Jinnah abandon his hopes of working jointly with Congress to achieve independence. \\r\\nNoorani is firmly of the view that Jinnah wanted a loose confederation in which the rights of the Muslim population were fully guaranteed rather than the separate state of Pakistan as it eventually emerged in 1947. He discusses Jinnah’s tactics during the crucial months in 1946 when the Cabinet Mission Plan was on the table, and argues that the Plan offered a viable possibility of avoiding Partition. In his opinion, the blame for its failure rests squarely with Congress and with Gandhi in particular, although trust and imagination were in short supply on all sides. The book includes three additional essays by the author, on respectively why the Suhrawardy-Bose plan for a united Bengal failed, the failure to provide effective safeguards for minorities in the Partition scheme, and the Haroon report of 1940, together with the text of some key documents.\\r\\n', 'Author Discription': 'A.G.

Using major theories of nationalism—including works of Benedict Anderson, Anthony D. Smith, John Breuilly, and Partha Chatterjee—and analysis of literary, political, and religious texts produced by Indian Muslims, Constructing Pakistan traces the varied Muslim responses to the post-1857 British ascendancy. These texts are employed to suggest that if the textual production of this period is read within the realm of politics and not just within the arena of culture, then the rise of Indian Muslim nationalism can be clearly traced within them and through their affective value for Indian Muslims.\\r\\nThe author argues that after 1857 the Muslim elite needed to force the dominant British regime into a hegemonic view of the Muslims, which also forced the elite to develop a political language that invoked the people in developing a new relationship between the British and the Indian Muslim elite. The rise of early Muslim exceptionalism and its eventual specific unfolding can then be read as political acts that long preceded Indian nationalist politics. The reason many historians cannot trace a pronounced Muslim sense of separate identity before the 1940s is because they trace this only through resistance or the shape of party politics, a practice that leaves the early loyalism of the Muslim elite unexplained. \\r\\nConstructing Pakistan attempts to re-read this loyalism as a sophisticated form of resistance that made the Muslim question central to British politics of the post-rebellion era.\\r\\n', 'Author Discription': 'Masood Ashraf Raja is an Assistant Professor of Postcolonial Literature and Theory at Kent State University, United States and the editor of Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies.

The anti-Shia fatwas were ‘managed’ through a Deobandi scholar of India, Manzur Numani, who had earlier written a book against Imam Khomeini and Iran. Funded by the Saudi charity Rabita Alam Islami (World Islamic League), he wrote to the Deobandi seminaries of India and Pakistan, asking them to give their juristic opinion on the Shia faith. In 1986, all of them sent to him fatwas declaring the Shias as kafirs or non-Muslims. No attention was paid by the state to the character of the Shia faith in Pakistan; a grave mistake made at the political level by politicians and military officers controlling and directing a very dubious jihad in Afghanistan and Kashmir.\\r\\nThe state colluded with the Shia massacres that followed next because the Shia-killers were all its proxy warriors. This book traces the roots of the sectarian conflict in the Muslim past in India, and throws light at the new developments in the Middle East after the replacement of the socialist Arab leaders with religious scholars, and the rise of Shia Iran under Imam Khomeini. It narrates and analyses the relocated Arab-Iran religious war inside Pakistan, leveraged with Saudi funds and executed by clerics who received spiritual and financial support from the clerical authorities in Saudi Arabia and Iran.

On the contrary, it provides incontrovertible documentary evidence that Dr Homi J. Bhabha formulated with Nehru’s approval a nuclear weapons development strategy within the structural framework of the Indian civilian nuclear programme. Nehru was interested in a nuclear weapons capability for a ‘deterrent in extremis’. \\r\\nThe study’s central premise is that the BJP government’s decision to carry out the May 1998 nuclear tests was not original, but a step prefigured in a strategic continuum whose genesis dates back to the late 1950s. It suggests that the declaration of Indian nuclear deterrence after the May 1998 nuclear tests, the weaponization of Indian nuclear capability and the pronouncement of the Draft Nuclear Doctrine were not separate from earlier policies, but instead were part of that strategic continuum.

G. Noorani', 'Book Description': 'The distinguished Indian lawyer and writer, A.G. Noorani, urges his readers in this incisively argued book to look again at some of the key events and personalities in the struggle against British colonial rule in India. He begins with ‘the forgotten comradeship’ between Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Whatever their other differences, both felt passionately about the cause of Indian freedom. Jinnah defended Tilak in his trial in 1916 on sedition charges, and ultimately secured his acquittal. The full text of the legal proceedings, including Jinnah’s powerful speeches for the defence, are included as an appendix. After Tilak’s death in 1920, Jinnah continued to work closely with political leaders of all persuasions and was regarded by the British as one of their most formidable opponents. Noorani argues that only in 1937, following the conflict over the formation of the provincial ministry in the United Provinces, did Jinnah abandon his hopes of working jointly with Congress to achieve independence. \\r\\nNoorani is firmly of the view that Jinnah wanted a loose confederation in which the rights of the Muslim population were fully guaranteed rather than the separate state of Pakistan as it eventually emerged in 1947. He discusses Jinnah’s tactics during the crucial months in 1946 when the Cabinet Mission Plan was on the table, and argues that the Plan offered a viable possibility of avoiding Partition. In his opinion, the blame for its failure rests squarely with Congress and with Gandhi in particular, although trust and imagination were in short supply on all sides.

Using major theories of nationalism—including works of Benedict Anderson, Anthony D. Smith, John Breuilly, and Partha Chatterjee—and analysis of literary, political, and religious texts produced by Indian Muslims, Constructing Pakistan traces the varied Muslim responses to the post-1857 British ascendancy. These texts are employed to suggest that if the textual production of this period is read within the realm of politics and not just within the arena of culture, then the rise of Indian Muslim nationalism can be clearly traced within them and through their affective value for Indian Muslims.\\r\\nThe author argues that after 1857 the Muslim elite needed to force the dominant British regime into a hegemonic view of the Muslims, which also forced the elite to develop a political language that invoked the people in developing a new relationship between the British and the Indian Muslim elite. The rise of early Muslim exceptionalism and its eventual specific unfolding can then be read as political acts that long preceded Indian nationalist politics. The reason many historians cannot trace a pronounced Muslim sense of separate identity before the 1940s is because they trace this only through resistance or the shape of party politics, a practice that leaves the early loyalism of the Muslim elite unexplained. \\r\\nConstructing Pakistan attempts to re-read this loyalism as a sophisticated form of resistance that made the Muslim question central to British politics of the post-rebellion era.\\r\\n', 'Author Discription': 'Masood Ashraf Raja is an Assistant Professor of Postcolonial Literature and Theory at Kent State University, United States and the editor of Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies.
